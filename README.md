## Description
This repository contains my project submission for the Front-end Developer position at Coalition Technologies. The website showcases my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and my ability to effectively use libraries such as jQuery and SwiperJS. Designed with a focus on SEO and ADA compliance, the website is optimized for accessibility and search engine visibility. A standout feature of the site is the hero section, where I implemented a parallax effect to enhance the visual experience. This project demonstrates my technical skills and my approach to creating modern, user-friendly web interfaces.

## Used Tech:
